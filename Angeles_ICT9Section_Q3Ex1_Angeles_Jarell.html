Swain being able to be granted a commission into the army, found out that he was gifted the power of the demon trapped in him. He later discovered that he could weild this power when a failed invasion caused him to lose his left hand which then reformed in a form of a ravens claw made from ancient mana.

One day during an ascension ritual to turn his most loyal comrades into God like creatures his so called eternal brother Xerath betrayed him killing him on the spot. This would cause Shurima to fall after Xerath tried stealing the power of the ascended causing his body to not hold such power devastating all of Shurima. After being revived a millenia after the fall of Shurima, he was able to ascend to god like creature like anubis and because his power grew so did his sand manipulation. From the debris of Shurima, he revived the city in an instant causing the rise of Shurima from dust again. </td>
